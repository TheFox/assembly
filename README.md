# Assembly

Assemble x86, i386, x86_64 instructions using PHP.

## Project Outlines

The project outlines as described in my blog post about [Open Source Software Collaboration](https://blog.fox21.at/2019/02/21/open-source-software-collaboration.html).

- The main purpose of this library is to provide an object-oriented approach to assemble Intel CPU instructions using PHP.
- The features should not go beyond Intel CPUs features and functions. So the features of this library are limited to those of Intel CPUs.
- This list is open. Feel free to request features.

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is via [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/thefox/assembly) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command to install the package and add it as a requirement to composer.json:

```bash
composer require thefox/assembly
```
